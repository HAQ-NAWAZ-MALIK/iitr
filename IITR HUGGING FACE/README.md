- Support for multiple languages (including Hindi, English, Thai, French, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean)
- Visualize OCR results with bounding boxes around detected text
- Search functionality within the extracted text
- Example images provided for testing
## Alternative Version

An alternative, ready-to-use version of this OCR application is available on Vercel. You can access it [here](https://iitr-haq-nawaz-maliks-projects.vercel.app/).
## Technologies Used

- Python
